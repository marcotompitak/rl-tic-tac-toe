# Tic Tac Toe with Reinforcement-Learned AI

This repo contains two things:

1. Python code to train an agent to play Tic Tac Toe using reinforcement learning.
2. A frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) to play against the AI.

The front-end code is forked from [vasanthk's work](https://github.com/vasanthk/tic-tac-toe-js). I only made the bare minimum modifications needed to integrate the AI and some minor stylistic changes.
